This is one of my very first projects where I apply my contextual knowledge of data cleaning and wrangling, 
exploratory analysis, data visualisation and some statistics. I didn't set any specific goals, but rather gave myself 
freedom in exploring what I can do to the data.

A1.R mostly features exploratory data visualisations, whilst in A2.R I applied logistic regression to predict 
the probability of being diabetic (1) based on plasma glucose concentrations. 

This project was completed with the help of chatGPT, which I mainly used to explain certain lines of code
or functions used in particular cases, hence some lines contain personal notes and comments.
